        G. Your Rights and Choices. The CCPA provides players who are California
        residents with specific rights regarding their personal information. You
        have the right to access the personal information we&rsquo;ve collected
        about you during the past 12 months and information about our data
        practice. You also have the right to request that we delete the personal
        information we have collected from you. Exercising Access and Deletion
        Rights To exercise the access and deletion rights described above,
        please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by contacting us as
        set forth below. Only you or a person registered with the California
        Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a
        verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. If you
        decide to use an authorized agent, please also include written
        permission that you have designated that agent to make this request, or
        proof of the agent&rsquo;s power of attorney. We may follow up with you
        to verify your identity before processing your authorized agent&rsquo;s
        request. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of
        your minor child. For your consumer request to be verifiable, you must:
        &bull; provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably
        verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information
        or an authorized representative. You will need to provide: (1) full name
        (2) date of birth (3) address (4) email address (5) whether you are a
        California consumer pursuant to CCPA (6) if you would like to know the
        specific pieces of personal information that we have collected about
        you, or to delete your personal information; (7) identification that
        clearly shows your name, date of birth and address (for example,
        passport or other photo identification); (8) describe your request with
        sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate and
        respond to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        H. We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal
        information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the
        request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a
        verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account
        with us. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable
        consumer request to verify the requestor&apos;s identity or authority to
        make the request.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        I. Response Timing and Format We endeavor to respond to a verifiable
        consumer request within 45 days of its receipt. If we require more time
        (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period
        in writing. If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written
        response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will
        deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.
        Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding
        the verifiable consumer request&apos;s receipt. The response we provide
        will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if
        applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to
        provide your personal information that is readily useable and should
        allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity
        without hindrance. We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your
        verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or
        manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee,
        we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost
        estimate before completing your request.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        J. We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA
        rights.
