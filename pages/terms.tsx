        is awarded to winners who are younger than eighteen (18) years of age or
        participate from any Restricted Jurisdiction (as defined below) or
        participate from a jurisdiction where the awarding of a prize based on

        illegal, or otherwise restricted.

        compliance. Further, you agree to comply with our Anti-Harassment Policy

      <p>I. Account Funding and Fees.</p>
      <p>
        You may add funds to your Account by making payment via an authorized
        payment method. We have the sole right to determine acceptable payment
        methods and to impose conditions, including additional fees, for the use
        of certain payment methods. Upon confirmation of payment, your Account
        will be credited with the amount of money you have paid. You may use the
        money deposited solely for the payment of entry fees for applicable
        competitions. Entry fees are payable in U.S. dollars, or cryptocurrency.
        All entry fees are deemed prepaid and are a prerequisite to your
        participation in any competition. All entry fees paid to enter a
        competition are final and you are not entitled to a refund of those
        entry fees for any reason. Any funds that were deposited to your
        Account, but not used to pay for entry fees may be withdrawn upon
        request if you have entered at least one (1) competition. Withdrawal
        requests are subject to our verification and due diligence process, and
        we reserve the right to seek any additional information from you before
        approving your withdrawal request in compliance with all applicable laws
        (including anti-fraud and anti-money laundering laws). Once the
        withdrawal request is approved, you will be mailed a check for the
        withdrawn amount to the address that you have designed as part of the
        Account registration process.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>J. Prizes.</p>
      <p>
        The winners of various competitions may be awarded cash/crypto prizes.
        The amount of the prize is disclosed to the players and predetermined
        ahead of the start of each competition. Once a competition concludes, we
        will conduct an internal review to ensure fairness and technical
        soundness. Once our verification process concludes, and subject to our
        right to request additional information and these Terms, we will notify
        the winners and issue them their prizes via check mailed to the address
        that they have designated as part of their Account registration process
        or other payment method as may be agreed to by you and us.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>K. Taxes.</p>
      <p>
        If you are a United States resident, we may send you an IRS Form W-9 and
        1099-MISC or other appropriate form if your prizes total $600 or more in
        any given calendar year. Depending on the state in which you reside, we
        may also send you additional federal or state tax forms. Without
        limiting the foregoing, we may withhold from your prizes any amount
        required to be withheld by applicable laws, including amounts due in
        connection with your failure to complete relevant tax documentation, but
        always you remain solely responsible for paying all federal, state and
        other taxes in accordance with all applicable laws in your state,
        country, and jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>L. Bonus and Promotional Funds.</p>
      <p>
        As part of our promotional efforts, we may from time-to-time issue
        bonuses or promotional funds that may be used for payment of entry fees.
        These bonus or promotional funds cannot be withdrawn, transferred, or
        converted into cash or any other asset for any reason. We reserve the
        right to set rules for the use of such bonus or promotional funds,
        including expiration dates. If you have any bonus or promotional funds
        associated with your Account at the time that you request a withdrawal
        of funds from your Account, you agree to forfeit all such associated
        bonus or promotional funds.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>M. Inactive Accounts and Closure.</p>
      <p>
        No maintenance fee will be assessed on any Account that is inactive (you
        have not entered any competitions in the past 6 months) however, we
        retain sole discretion to determine when and if to terminate any
        inactive accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>N. Additional Information, Withholding, and Forfeiture.</p>
      <p>
        We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to request additional
        information from you before issuing a prize. Such additional information
        may be personally identifying information, such as your name, address,
        and social security number, to enable us to comply with our obligations
        under applicable tax laws. If you do not or refuse to provide the
        requested information, any prizes that you may have won will be
        forfeited. Additionally, we reserve the right to review each
        competition, verify your information and the information that you have
        provided, and conduct all due diligence that we may deem necessary
        before issuing your prize. The time that the review and verification
        process vary on a case-by-case basis and shall be conducted in our sole
        discretion with no obligation or liability to you. If we determine, in
        our sole discretion, that the fairness or integrity of the competition
        was compromised, there was a technical issue, malfunction, or other
        problem that affected the outcome, we reserve the right to cancel the
        competition, cancel all prizes, and refund the entry fees to all
        participating players. Notwithstanding this provision, any violation of
        these Terms by you also permits us to freeze your Account and cause you
        to forfeit any deposited funds or any prizes, with or without prior
        notice.

        award benefits or prizes and require the return of any prizes, if a
        player engages in conduct or otherwise utilizes any information that we
        deem to be improper, unfair, or otherwise adverse to the operation of
        the site or is in any way detrimental to other players. These Terms
        further prohibit entering a competition if the entrant is:

      </p>
      <p>
        An employee of our sponsor, consultant, or supplier, or any other third

        determination and discretion breached any of these Terms. Further, we
        retain the sole discretion to terminate any Account for any reason or no
        reason at all; however, we agree to refund any funds deposited in such
        terminated account, unless the player has committed a breach of these
        Terms and has forfeited such funds in accordance with these Terms.

      <p>Q. Termination/Cancellation of Competition and Refund of Entry Fee.</p>
      <p>

        for a terminated or cancelled competition will have their entry fees

        <br />
      </p>

        By entering into a competition or accepting any prize, players,
        including but not limited to the winner(s), agree to indemnify, release
        and to hold harmless us, our affiliates and agents, as well as the

        competition is permitted by law, all players and winners consent to the
        use of their name, voice, and likeness/photograph in and in connection

        sanction for the offending party, which may include termination of the

      <p>
        As part of our Services, we offer players the opportunity to communicate
        through chat and similar functions associated with our site. We believe
        in a fair-play, discrimination-free, and harassment-free environment
        available to all and we take all allegations of misconduct and
        harassment seriously. We have a zero-tolerance anti-harassment policy
        and reserve the right to determine (in our sole and absolute discretion)
        whether the policy has been violated, and the appropriate sanction for
        the offending party, which may include termination of the account, a
        permanent ban, forfeiture of all account funds and any associated prize
        winnings. Without limitation, the following conduct is prohibited:
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Use of offensive, derogatory, racist, and/or racially or ethnically
        charged language.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use of sexually charged language, including language that threatens
        sexual violence, is demeaning towards any sex or gender, is homophobic
        or transphobic, and/or is otherwise targeting any sex or gender.
      </p>
      <p>Hate speech and cyber-bullying.</p>
      <p>Accusations against others in our community; and</p>
      <p>
        Any overly violent, threatening, indecent, or otherwise inappropriate
        language that is unsportsmanlike and without place in our gaming
        community. While we realize that competition is exciting, we strongly
        believe in ensuring a safe, sportsmanlike, and civil environment for all
        players, regardless of their race, ethnicity, gender, sexual
        orientation, or any other characteristic. Keep it fun, keep it friendly,
        and above all remember that playing video games is supposed to be for
        entertainment. If you believe that you have been subjected to any
        inappropriate conduct, please contact us at info@gamepayy.com and
        provide as much information as possible, including the identities of the
        parties involved and any screen cap or recording of the alleged
        incident, so that we may properly investigate and address the matter.

        prizes, participation in competitions, and playing the site
        (&ldquo;Gaming Laws&rdquo;) vary between the various states in the
        United States and among the different countries of the world. Currently,
        we do not permit players to access or play any real-money entry fee
        competitions or receive any prizes from the following jurisdictions:
        Arizona, Arkansas, Louisiana, Montana, South Carolina, and South Dakota.
        (&ldquo;Restricted Jurisdictions&rdquo;). You agree that you will not

        your ability to access the Services or the site (or to pay entry fees or
        receive prizes) from outside the Restricted Jurisdictions complies with
        all applicable laws. It is your sole responsibility to determine your
        own compliance with all applicable laws.
      </p>

        that prohibit or restrict your ability to access the Services, play the
        site, pay entry fees, and/or receive any prizes (&ldquo;Other
        Laws&rdquo;). Even if you are not in a Restricted Jurisdiction, it is
        your responsibility to verify all applicable federal, state, and local
        laws and regulations to ensure that your activities related to the
        Services and the site comply with all those laws and regulations.
        Regardless of whether the Software permits your access, you may not
        access the Services or participate in the site if doing so (or if
        receiving any prizes) will be a violation of any law or regulation.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>7. Dispute Resolution.</p>
      <p>A. General.</p>
      <p>
        This Section 9 applies to any Dispute except for Disputes relating to
        the enforcement or validity of our intellectual property rights, which
        we may address through litigation or any other appropriate method
        without regard to this Section. The term &ldquo;Dispute&rdquo; means any
        dispute, action or other controversy between you and us concerning these
        Terms, the Services, the site, or any other product, service, or
        information we make available to you, whether in contract, warranty,
        tort, statute, regulation, ordinance or any other legal or equitable
        basis. &ldquo;Dispute&rdquo; will be given the broadest possible meaning
        allowable under law. In the event of a Dispute, you or we must give the
        other a Notice of Dispute, which is a written statement that sets forth
        the name, address and contact information of the party giving it, the
        facts giving rise to the Dispute, any supporting evidence (such as
        communications or screenshots), and the relief requested. You must send
        any Notice of Dispute by U.S. Mail to Game Payy, Inc., 1750 N Bayshore
        Dr., Miami, FL 33132 and by email to info@gamepayy.com. We will send any
        Notice of Dispute to you by U.S. Mail to your address if we have it, or
        otherwise to your email address, and you agree to receive any Notices of
        Dispute either by mail or email. The parties will strive to negotiate
        and attempt to resolve the dispute for a period of at least sixty (60)
        days (&ldquo;Formal Complaint Process&rdquo;). After the sixty (60) day
        period, either party may initiate arbitration as provided in this
        Section. You agree to use the Formal Complaint Process before initiating
        arbitration or any small claims case.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>B. Arbitration.</p>
      <p>
        If the Dispute is not resolved through the Formal Complaint Process, you
        and we agree that any dispute arising out of or relating to this
        Agreement or our Services, including, without limitation, federal and
        state statutory claims, common law claims, and those based in contract,
        tort, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, shall be
        resolved through final binding arbitration, on an individual basis (the
        &ldquo;Arbitration Agreement&rdquo;). Subject to applicable
        jurisdictional requirements, you may elect to pursue your claim in your
        local small claims court rather than through arbitration so long as your
        matter remains in small claims court and proceeds only on an individual
        (non-class and non-representative) basis. Arbitration shall be conducted
        in accordance with the American Arbitration Association&rsquo;s rules
        for arbitration of consumer-related disputes (accessible at
        https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf).This
        Arbitration Agreement includes, without limitation, disputes arising out
        of or related to the interpretation or application of the Arbitration
        Agreement, including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or
        validity of the Arbitration Agreement or any portion of the Arbitration
        Agreement. All such matters shall be decided by an arbitrator and not by
        a court or judge.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>C. Procedure.</p>
      <p>
        The arbitration will be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator and
        shall take place in the State of New York, telephonically, or remotely,
        or another mutually agreeable location, in the English language. The
        arbitrator may award any relief that a court of competent jurisdiction
        could award, and the arbitral decision may be enforced in any court. An
        arbitrator&rsquo;s decision and judgment thereon will not have a
        precedential or collateral estoppel effect. Hearings may be conducted
        remotely (by phone or video conferencing software) and the arbitrator
        may provide for submitting and determining motions on briefs, without
        oral argument.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>D. CLASS ACTION WAIVER.</p>
      <p>
        TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN
        A PARTY&rsquo;S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS
        MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, COLLECTIVE ACTION, OR REPRESENTATIVE
        PROCEEDING (COLLECTIVELY &ldquo;CLASS ACTION WAIVER&rdquo;). THE
        ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON&rsquo;S CLAIMS OR
        ENGAGE IN ANY CLASS OF ARBITRATION. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT, BY AGREEING TO
        THESE TERMS, YOU AND WE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY
        AND THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>E. Attorney&rsquo;s Fees and Costs.</p>
      <p>
        In any Dispute, each party shall bear its own attorney fees and any
        related costs incurred as part of the Dispute Resolutions Process in
        this Section.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>F. Opt Out.</p>
      <p>
        You have the right to opt out of and not to be bound by the arbitration
        and class action waiver provisions set forth in these Terms. To exercise
        this right, you must send written notice of your decision to: Game Payy,
        Inc. 1750 N Bayshore Dr, Miami, FL 33132 and by email to
        info@gamepayy.com. Your notice must include your name, mailing address,
        and username associated with your Account, and state that you do not
        wish to resolve disputes with us through arbitration. To be effective,
        this notice must be postmarked or deposited or received by us (if sent
        by email) within 30 days of the date on which you first accepted these
        Terms unless a longer period is required by applicable law; otherwise,
        you will be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with this section.
        You are responsible for ensuring that we receive you opt-out notice, so
        you may wish to send it by a means that provides for a delivery receipt.
        If you opt out of these arbitration provisions, we will not be bound by
        them with respect to any Disputes with you.

      <p>A. General.</p>
      <p>
        We respect the intellectual property of others and expect our users and
        players to do the same. If you believe that there has been a violation
        of your copyright, trademark, or any other intellectual property rights,
        please follow the procedures in this section to notify us.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>

      <p>
        We will process and investigate notices of alleged infringement and will
        take appropriate actions under the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act
        (&rdquo; DMCA&rdquo;) and other applicable intellectual property laws. A
        notification of alleged copyright infringement should be emailed and

        Line:&rdquo; DMCA Takedown Request&rdquo;). You may also send your DMCA

        <br />
      </p>
      <p>C. Requirements.</p>
      <p>
        In accordance with the DMCA, the notification must be in writing and
        contain the following information:

      </p>
      <p>D. Counter-Notice.</p>
      <p>
        If you receive a notice of infringement from us, and believe that your
        user content that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not
        infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner,
        the copyright owner&rsquo;s agent, or pursuant to the law, to post and
        use the content, you may send a written counter-notice containing the
        following information to our Copyright agent (at the contact information
        set forth in subsection B above):
      </p>

      <p>
        If a counter-notice is received by our Copyright Agent, we will send a
        copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing
        that person that we may replace the removed content or cease disabling
        it in ten (10) business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action
        seeking a court order against the user alleged to have committed
        copyright infringement, the removed content may be replaced, or access
        to it restored, in fourteen (14) days or more after receipt of the
        counter-notice, at our sole discretion.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />

        policy of terminating, as may be appropriate and in our sole discretion,
        the Account and access of users or players who are deemed to be repeat
        infringers. We may also at our sole discretion limit access and/or
        terminate the participation of any users or players who infringe any
        intellectual property rights of others, whether there is any repeat
        infringement.

        registering for an Account and using the site, in accordance with the
        Privacy Policy, so please read it carefully. Like these Terms, the
        Privacy Policy may change from time to time, and your continued access

        acceptance of the Privacy Policy as amended, and thus it is important
        for you to periodically access and review the Privacy Policy.
